Components used:
    * Raspberry Pi 4​
    * Breadboard​
    * LDR sensor​
    * DHT22 sensor​
    * Capacitor​
    * Female-to-male jumper wires​
    * Male-to-male jumper wires

Connections:
    1. Connect the LDR sesnor to the breadboard​
    2. Connect one end of a male-to-male jumper wire to the same column as the positive leg of the LDR sensor and the other end to the positive power rail​
    3. Connect the femaile side of a female-to-male jumper wire to GPIO Pin 21 (pin 40) on the Raspberry Pi and the male side to a point next to the negative leg of the LDR sensor​
    4. Connect the postive leg of the capacitor to the a point after the female-to-male jumper wire connected to GPIO21​
    5. Connect one end of  a male-to-male jumper wire to the same column as the negative leg of the capacitor and the other end to the negative power rail to ground the circuit​
    6. Connect the DHT22 sensor to the bread board​
    7. Connect a one end of a male-to-male jumper wire to the same column as positive terminal on the DHT22 sensor and the other to the positive power rail​
    8. Connect one end of a male-to-male jumper wire to the same column negative terminal on the DHT22 sensor and the other to the negative power rail​
    9. Connect the female end of the female-to-male jumper wire to GPIO Piin 20 (pin38) on the Raspberry Pi and the male end to the same column as the middle terminal of the DHT22 sensor​
    10. Connect the female side of a female-to-male jumper wire to the 3V GPIO Pin (pin 1)on the Raspberry Pi and the male side to the positive power rail on the breadboard​
    11. Connect the female side of a female-to-male jumper wire to the ground GPIO Pin (pin 6) on the Raspberry Pi to the negative power rail on the breadboard

Logging:​
    * Readings are retrieved from the sensors and then stored in the arrays in batches of 1000​
Storage:​
    * Once 1000 readings are retrieved from the arrays they will be written into a textfile and then the array is cleared to save system memory​
Transmission:​
    * Once the next 1000 sensor readings are retrieved from the sensors they will be saved to a textfile as well and then the 1000 readings before will be transmitted to the web server and then deleted from the local storage location.​
    * To simlate web server transmission via TCP we will move the file to another folder on the device

This code is will read the light intensity, temperature and humidity. The light intensity will be read using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) along with a capacitor, 
the temperature and humidity will be read using the DHT22 sensor. Make the necessary component connections and run the program on a Raspberry Pi.
Run these commands on the terminal before running the program
